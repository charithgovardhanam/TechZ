Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors.
Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's.
Parkinson's often starts with a tremor in one hand. Other symptoms are slow movement, stiffness and loss of balance.
Medication can help control the symptoms of Parkinson's.
As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. 
They may also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.
Both men and women can have Parkinson's disease. 
However, the disease affects about 50 percent more men than women.
